# Transactional analysis of a computer store
The code presented in this project performs an analysis of electronic product sales transactions from two companies: Electronidex and Blackwell. 
The goal of the analysis is to identify improvement opportunities for Blackwell.

- The first step in the analysis is to conduct an exploration of the data. It is observed that the two companies use different product categories, 
  so they are unified. The 22 categories that match or are similar in both companies are selected.

- Next, association rules between product categories are calculated. These rules identify products that are commonly purchased together.

- Finally, transactions are segmented into two groups: B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consumer). 
  The segmentation is based on the number of products from each category purchased in each transaction.

- Key results of the analysis:
  
  The best-selling product categories in both companies are laptops, monitors, and accessories.
  The most important association rules identify products that are often bought together, such as laptops and monitors, or printers and printer ink.
  B2B transactions tend to be larger than B2C transactions.
